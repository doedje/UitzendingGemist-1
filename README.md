# ![Apple TV](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1049693/11407062/c1891a92-93b0-11e5-9270-745cf4fa4152.png) Uitzending Gemist 

```UitzendingGemist``` is an unofficial native application for the Apple TV developed in [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). It will allow you to browse and watch all video streams of the Nederlandse Publieke Omroep's (e.g. NPO, the Dutch public broadcaster) [Uitzending Gemist](http://www.npo.nl/uitzending-gemist) website on your Apple TV.

Watching videos is very snappy and almost instantaneous, contrary to streaming from your iDevice to Apple TV over Airplay or using the built-in player in your smart tv.

# Okay, that's great! But how do I get this on my ![Apple TV](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1049693/11407062/c1891a92-93b0-11e5-9270-745cf4fa4152.png)?

Unfortunately the app cannot be distributed in the Appstore as the NPO does not allow third parties in doing so. However, using a free Apple Developer account you *can* compile it yourself and install it in your own Apple TV 4. 

**Prerequisites:**

- an [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/tv/) 4th generation (the one that has an AppStore)
- a recent Apple Computer running ```OS X 10.10.x Yosemite``` or ```OS X 10.11.x El Capitan```
- a (free) Apple Developer account (signup [here](http://developer.apple.com))
- a [USB-C cable](http://www.apple.com/nl/shop/product/HHSP2ZM/B/belkin-usb-c-naar-usb-a-oplaadkabel?fnode=85) to connect your Apple TV to your Apple Computer

## 1. Xcode

The code was developed in [Xcode 7.1.1](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) so you need at least to have that version installed. Continue with the following steps when you have finished installing ```Xcode``` as the next steps require a finished installation.

## 2. Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is the missing package manager for OS X which can be used to install all sorts of open source projects. To install, execute the following command in ```Terminal```:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

## 3. Carthage

The code relies on a number of dependencies that are managed by the [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) dependency manager. Before working with the code you first need to [install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage). Execute the following command in ```Terminal``` to install ```Carthage``` via ```Homebrew```:

```
brew install carthage
```

## 4. Clone the project

It is advisable to have a ```Developer``` folder on your machine. Execute the following code in ```Terminal``` to create those folders and clone this project:

```
mkdir -p ~/Developer/tvOS
cd ~/Developer/tvOS
git clone https://github.com/4np/UitzendingGemist.git
cd UitzendingGemist
```

## 5. Fetching and compiling dependencies

Now that you have ```Xcode``` and ```Carthage``` on your system, you can fetch and compile the depencies. Execute the following command in ```Terminal``` from within your project folder to fetch and compile the dependencies.

```
cd ~/Developer/tvOS/UitzendingGemist
carthage bootstrap
```

## 6. Open the project

Now that everything is in place, you can open the project file ```UitzendingGemist.xcodeproj``` in ```Finder```. Alternatively, when you still have ```Terminal``` open you can also execute the following command:

```
open UitzendingGemist.xcodeproj
```

## 7. Connect the Apple TV 4 to your computer

Connect the ```Apple TV 4``` using the USB-C cable to your Mac. 


## 8. Set the bundle identifier

See the screenshot below and click on **1** and **2** to get to the screen shown below. Set the bundle identifier (**3**) to some name. This should be something in reverse domain format, for example ```com.JohnAppleseed.UitzendingGemist```.

## 9. Select the team

In order to deploy the application to the Apple TV it needs to be signed with your team (see **4** in the screenshot above). If you do not have a team (e.g. ```None```), or you see the message ```No Matching provisioning profiles found``` click the ```Fix Issue``` and login with your Apple ID / Apple Developer Account credentials.

## 10. Select the Build Device

On the top left in Xcode click on the device the compiled program will be deployed to (see **5** in the screnshot above). If your Apple TV 4 is properly connected you will be able to pick you Apple TV device (otherwise it will run in the Simulator).

## 11. Run the application

Finally you are able to compile the program and deploy it onto your Apple TV! Click the play icon (see **6** in the screenshot above). The application will be compiled and deployed on your Apple TV 4. After this the application will remain on the Apple TV. 

## 12. Sit back and enjoy :)

You're done! You can disconnect your Apple TV and start watching! :)
